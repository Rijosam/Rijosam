<h1> Java Beyond Frameworks: Avoiding Lock-In with Agnostic Design </h1>

The Problem: Modern Java applications often become prisoners of their frameworks. While tools like Spring Boot and Quarkus accelerate development, they create hidden costs: vendor lock-in, bloated dependencies and rigid architectures. What happens when your project outgrows your framework—or a new, better tool emerges?

The Solution: This talk introduces a layered approach to Java development, isolating framework dependencies while keeping core logic pure with Java and Jakarta EE. Through examples, you’ll see:

- How to decouple business logic using JSR standards
- Strategies to replace framework-specific annotations
- Cloud integration without framework coupling

Trade-Offs: Yes, this demands more upfront effort—writing custom persistence layers, rigorous tests, and meticulous docs. But the payoff is code that’s adaptable, testable, and maintainable across frameworks, teams, and decades.

Key Takeaways:

- Practical patterns for agnostic design.
- When (and when not) to adopt this approach.
- Tools to ease the transition.
