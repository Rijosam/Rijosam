<h1> Tulips to Turmeric: Lessons Learned from a Global Team </h1>

Ever wondered why working in global teams feels like unravelling a mystery? You're not alone! The reality of working within such a team can differ from expectations. Often, the greatest challenge for developers isn't the actual work, but rather navigating the distance, understanding cultural disparities, and maintaining meaningful connections with team members.

Today, whether we work in Amsterdam or New Delhi, Brussels or Beijing, we are all part of a global network where success requires traversing vastly different cultural realities. But how do you deliver constructive feedback to colleagues from Asia, America, or Europe? And why does your Indian team really need an hour for lunch? Also, do you know the secret that a ‘NO’ can come in many disguises?

In this session, I will share personal stories and practical strategies from my years of working with multicultural teams. These strategies aim to enhance communication, bridge cultural gaps, and foster strong collaboration across continents. Join me as we embark on a journey filled with laughter, learning, and limitless possibilities.
